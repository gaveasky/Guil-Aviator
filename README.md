# Guil-Aviator
Personal Blog and Study Reference.

This is a personal project of a website where I will post about things which I find interesting,
as well as aviation and things that I study.

The main purpose of this subject is for me to refine my HTML/CSS skills in process of having
a place to document and to organize my thoughts.

I decided to publish on GH as a means of familiarizing myself with the environment.
Stupidly, I committed everything to the master branch. Once I release 1.0 I will create a beta
for experimentation.
